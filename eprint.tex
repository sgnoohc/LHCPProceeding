\begin{Abstract}

HERE IS YOUR ABSTRACT.  REPLACE THE TEXT. The second annual Large Hadron Collider Physics (LHCP) conference will be held at Columbia University in New York City from June 2-7, 2014. The conference is jointly hosted by Brookhaven National Laboratory and Columbia University. This conference is a result of a recent merger of two international conferences: "Physics at Large Hadron Collider" and "Hadron Collider Physics Symposium".

\section{Introduction}

HERE IS YOUR INTRODUCTION, REPLACE THE TEXT

The program will be devoted to a review of the latest experimental and theoretical results on hadron collider physics and a discussion on the outlook for the coming years. The conference intends to provide a lively discussion between experimenters and theorists on topics such as the Standard Model Physics and Beyond, the Higgs Boson, Supersymmetry and Heavy Ion Physics and planning for the high luminosity upgrades.

\section{Observations}

REPLACE THE TEXT, FIGURE and TABLE.
