\abstract{
We present a summary of the current status of measurements in multiboson final states at the LHC from the ATLAS and CMS experiments.
Studying the rare productions of electroweak multibosons at the LHC can probe new physics beyond the energy reach of the LHC.
Various searches for rare processes involving multiboson interactions are presented and their impacts on the constraints on new physics in the framework of Standard Model Effective Field Theory are also discussed.
A brief highlight of the high luminosity LHC projection study is discussed as well.
